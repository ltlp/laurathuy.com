				<h3>Flask API & RethinkDB</h3>
				<h4><b>Date:</b> October - December 2019</h4>
				<h4><b>Emphasis:</b> Data Acquisition, Data Persistence, Data API Programming</h4>
				<h4><b>Description:</b> Directed through my Systems and Analytics Programming course, this independent project was an exploration into data acquisition, data persistence, data value, data exposure, and API programming using Python.</h4>
				<h4><b>Source Code:</b><a href="https://github.com/ltlp/projects/tree/master/Flask%20API%20%26%20RethinkDB"> View</a></h4>
				<h5><b>REPORT</b></h5>
				<h6><b>Data Acquisition</b></h6>
				<p>The data I chose to collect is from <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/data">REI's Mountain Project Data API</a>. Mountain Project (MP) is an online application dedicated to helping rock climbers find climbing routes, mark routes they have climbed, and find climbing partners. As an avid climber, I utilize MP pretty frequently and decided to use it as my data source.</p>
				<p>The data is in JSON format. The Python script allows the user to input latitude, longitude, maxDistance (specifies mile radius), and maxResults (specifies how many routes to return). I used two test inputs to pull a total of 1000 routes from MP. The private key was generated under one of my accounts.</p>
				<p>Additionally, here are the fields:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>id:</b> route ID</li>
					<li><b>name:</b> name of the route</li>
					<li><b>type:</b> type of climbing (i.e. sport, boulder, trad)</li>
					<li><b>rating:</b> route difficulty</li>
					<li><b>stars:</b> climber rating of the route</li>
					<li><b>starVotes:</b> how many people rated the route</li>	
					<li><b>pitches:</b> number of pitches on the route</li>
					<li><b>location:</b> where the route is</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Data Persistence</b></h6>
				<p>The database I used is RethinkDB. It is hosted locally.</p>
				<p>I chose RethinkDB because of its straightforward setup and its specialization with hosting JSON data, which is the data type returned from my Python script in the data acquisition section. I chose to host the server locally because of the ease and compatibility with my current level of skills.</p>
				<p><i>Note:</i> The server is named “applesauce”.</p>
				<p>To view RethinkDB in the browser, type <span>localhost:8080</span> in the URL bar.</p>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Data Value</b></h6>
				<p>I did not use a Python script to add value to the data. Instead, the data was converted from a .JSON file to a .CSV file via an <a href="http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm">online converter</a>. Following this process, I uploaded the data to Power BI and made all data value changes from there.</p>
				<p>The column labeled “url” was changed to <i>Data Category: Web URL</i> so I could include it as a hyperlink in the visual report. The columns “imgSqSmall”, “imgSmall”, “imgSmallMed”, and “imgMedium” were changed to <i>Data Category: Image URL</i> for the same reason as the “url” column change.</p>
				<p>The column “starVotes” was changed in the visual report (but not in the backend) to “Number of Votes” for better clarity.</p>
				<p>All other value was emphasized through the visual report. The visual report is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pwwwb6ZnIKb3ape7A2XbBN0XAO7BFbyo/view?usp=sharing">Power BI dashboard</a> highlighting the data.</p>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Data Exposure</b></h6>
				<p>Flask was used as the data API. The API does not allow for users to do anything but view the data originally collected from the data acquisition section.</p>
				<p>To view the Flask API and receive the URL address for the data, type this in the browser: <span>http://127.0.0.1:5001/</span></p>

				<h3>WriterWorkshop.com</h3>
				<h4><b>Date:</b> September - December 2019</h4>
				<h4><b>Emphasis:</b> Web Development with HTML / CSS / JS</h4>
				<h4><b>Description:</b> This group project was conducted through my Designing Graphical User Interfaces for Electronic Commerce course. It was a semester-long production emphasizing user interface design, HTML structuring, CSS implementation, and JavaScript development.</h4>
				<h4><b>Source Code:</b><a href="https://github.com/ltlp/projects/tree/master/WriterWorkshop.com"> View</a></h4>
				<h5><b>OVERVIEW</b></h5>
				<h6><b>WriterWorkshop.com</b></h6>
				<p>The web application we designed is called WriterWorkshop.com. This website enables users to post their creative writing on a forum and receive feedback from other writers. It provides writers with a resource they can utilize to better their original pieces.</p>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Objectives</b></h6>
				<p>The project objective is altruism. Below are three ways this will be accomplished:</p>
				<p><b><i>Give writers a platform for sharing and receiving constructive feedback.</i></b><br>
				Users can post their comments and suggestions to other writers’ submitted work. This will aid in writing development and improvement, as the web application aims to create a platform that gives users a space to freely express their thoughts on other people’s writing. Users will depend on honest and genuine answers from a community of writers and editors.</p>
				<p><b><i>Host a healthy environment for writers to communicate with other writers in a general forum.</i></b><br>
				For users who don’t want to post something but want to brainstorm or start a conversation, there is a general forum that allows writers to collaborate and discuss ideas. The goal is to create a web application that users can trust in order to bring their thoughts to light.</p>
				<p><b><i>Provide a free, open resource.</i></b><br>
				The altruistic approach of this web application is rooted in the fact that this is free for all users. By providing a no-pay forum that is open to the community, it allows everyone to share their writing and ideas without money being a concern.</p>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Webpages</b></h6>
				<p>There is a master CSS file [master.css] that dictates a consistent style among every page.</p>

				<h3>PSTRMI</h3>
				<h4><b>Date:</b> January - April 2019</h4>
				<h4><b>Emphasis:</b> Project Management, Database Administration, Application Development</h4>
				<h4><b>Description:</b> This project was created with a small team for Steiny’s Family Sports Bar and Grill in Logan, UT. Designed to track, organize, and view inventory levels, PSTRMI (Programmable System for Tracking and Recording Modifications to Inventory) is a desktop application developed with Visual Basic and Microsoft SQL Server.</h4>

				<h5><b>SYSTEM REQUEST</b></h5>
				<h6><b>Goal Statement</b></h6>
				<p>By April 18, 2019, JLI will deliver an inventory tracking
				desktop application for Steiny’s Family Sports Grill that
				can help reduce inventory input error and/or
				calculation error by 25% at little or no cost to the
				client.</p>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Business Needs</b></h6>
				<p>Due to the fact that the current inventory system is out of date and disorganized, with
				very limited information/data being generated, Steiny’s needs a new inventory tracking
				system. Inventory orders are placed with mistakes and ingredients run out before the
				next inventory order due to errors made by employees when they are “just looking for
				what is low.” A reconciliation between what is purchased and what has actually been
				used is not available (i.e. no idea how much free food is given away). Also, there are no
				alerts when an ingredient is low (i.e. down to one package).</p>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Business Requirements</b></h6>
				<ul>
					<li>Show current level of inventory.</li>
					<li>Notify manager when items are running low.</li>
					<li>Update ingredient levels based on menu items sold.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Business Value</b></h6>
				<p>The inventory tracking system will help Steiny’s reduce inventory error by 25%, which will
				increase accuracy and efficiency. The system will also reduce costs in the form of
				wasted and/or expired inventory (food). Customer satisfaction will increase due to an
				organized inventory. The company will save $280/month in free/voided/stolen food
				purchases (20% of a monthly average total of $1400) as well as save $150 in wasted
				food (calculated from JJ’s estimate).</p>
				<br>
				<h6><b>Special Issues</b></h6>
				<p>Possible issues could include compatibility issues that result from off-menu or custom
				orders and user error when data is inputted into the inventory system.</p>

				<h3>Data Analytics Consulting Project</h3>
				<h4><b>Date:</b> August - December 2017</h4>
				<h4><b>Emphasis:</b> Big Data Analytics, Data Modeling, Business Intelligence (BI)</h4>
				<h4><b>Description:</b> This project required working with a small group to address business issues regarding advertising, hiring, and company costs using data analysis techniques. The project emphasized the use of data programs such as RapidMiner and Microsoft SQL Server to run various analyses in order to provide data-centric recommendations for a client.</h4>
				<h4><b>Full Report:</b><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u8c3ooRCh06wv9d3XxFfhV7a6tsznp32"> View</a></h4>
				<h5><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></h5>
				<p>This report is the result of a request from Atomyak to utilize their sales, customers,
				products, and employee data to produce data-centric recommendations on how they
				can increase their profits by changing how they conduct some aspects of their
				business.</p>
				<p>The first concern that Atomyak had us analyze with was their advertising targeting and
				messaging. Through a k-Means clustering analysis we were able to identify four
				customer sets and specific messages that we recommend Atomyak use to target their
				messaging and advertisement using their 25-million-dollar budget.</p>
				<p>The second issue we worked on was reducing the number of kayaks that needed to be
				sent to the in-house shop to add trims; a long process whose wait time frustrated and
				even deterred some customers from buying altogether. To solve this, we analyzed
				sales data using association rules in order to determine if there was a trim combination
				purchased often enough to justify making that combination a standard model for stores
				to have in stock. We found four combinations, described them, and explained how to
				market them to customers. We recommend that the shops should keep these preconfigured
				models in stock to cut back on the wait time for custom kayaks.</p>
				<p>The third inefficiency they noted was hiring, retaining, and promoting sales staff. We
				conducted a linear regression to find the 'BestEmployee' and 'PotentialHire' using
				MgrScore, SC Rank, HelpScore, and Lawsuit. From the model we were able to form two
				formulas (on a scale from 1 to 5) that Atomyak can use to determine who to hire,
				retain, and promote.</p>
				<p>Finally, Atomyak was concerned about the amount of money being spent on sending
				damaged kayaks through the diagnostics bay before being sent to their required
				service departments. Through a decision tree analysis, we determined three problems
				that could be predicted well enough through our model to financially justify skipping
				the diagnostics bay and instead sending them straight to their required service
				departments. We recommend running problems observed in the shop through our
				model and skipping the diagnostics bay if the model outputs a “reactor”, “electrical”, or
				“other” result.</p>
